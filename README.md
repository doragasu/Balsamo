An interface for unwanted calls filtering, from the spanish acronym "Bloqueador Avanzado de Llamadas Sistemáticas, Automáticas, Molestas y Ocultas"

This project uses a custom PCB equipped with a dsPIC30F6014 for telephone signal sampling, FSK demodulation and system and user interfaces. It also includes an SD card interface used to load and store system configuration, allowed/restricted phone numbers and raw audio files to be played back to the caller.

Everything (source code and board files) is GPLv3+ licensed.

More info and files to come soon!
